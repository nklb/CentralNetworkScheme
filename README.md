A preprint of the paper will be available soon.

Julia codes were written by N. Kolbe

## Contents
The repository contains a Julia project environment, which includes the package `CentralNetworkScheme.jl` implementating the schemes, and a directory (`experiments`) with scripts for various numerical experiments. The former implements schemes for 1-to-1 and 2-to-1 networks. Flux functions and boundary conditions can be freely chosen. Users can either use the first or the second order central scheme. For the LWR model on 2-to-1 networks the central coupling approach can be replaced by the flow maximization approach. 

Experiments on 1-to-1 networks for the Burgers' equation (`experiments/Burgers11.jl`) and on 2-to-1 networks for the LWR model (`experiments/LWR21.jl`) and the Buckley-Leverett equation (`experiments/BL21`) are included in the `experiments` folder.

## Usage 
Clone the repository on your local machine. To run the scripts activate the project environment, for example, by starting `julia` from the command line within the root folder of the repository, then changing to pkg mode typing `]` and afterwards running `activate .`. Then the experiments can be run by including the corresponding scripts, e.g., `include("experiments/LWR21.jl")`.  You can get started by going through the scripts and modifying them as you like. Scripts are commented and further documentation  will be added in the future.
